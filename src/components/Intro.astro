    <p class="mb-5">
      The MOCO’24 conference in Utrecht marks the 10-year anniversary of the
      pioneering MOCO initiative, which has brought together researchers from
      the arts, humanities and sciences for interdisciplinary encounters at the
      intersection of movement and computing. Since MOCO is organised this year
      at the Faculty of Humanities of Utrecht University, this conference puts
      the spotlight on the critical potential of exchanges between arts,
      humanities and sciences. How can arts and performance be understood as a
      place for exploration and inspiration, as a ‘testbed’ for new ideas
      relating to movement and computing? MOCO’24 also offers (a limited amount
      of) vouchers for artists for free participation in the conference, as well
      as by providing the possibility of presenting artistic research, and by
      including performance visits to relevant shows at the SPRING Festival in
      the conference programme.
