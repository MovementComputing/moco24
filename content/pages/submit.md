## Submission Format and Procedure

In this MOCO conference, we give you the option to publish your paper in the conference proceedings that will be indexed and published in the ACM digital library. We call this the ‘ACM publication track’. However, it is also possible to only submit an abstract of your presentation for review. In this case, your paper will not be published in the ACM conference proceedings.

All types of submissions (abstracts and papers) will be peer-reviewed by the MOCO community.

Please see the Call for Proposals for detailed instructions.

Submissions in the ACM publication track should be in pdf format and should use the ACM proceedings format: [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)

All papers submissions must be as anonymous as possible, including references that may reveal the author(s).

**All submissions must be made through Oxford Abstracts, this is the link for submissions:** [https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/6986/submitter](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/6986/submitter)

## A note on reviews: For MOCO by MOCO

Please note that after submitting your proposal to the MOCO conference, you may be approached by the MOCO Programme Committee to act as a reviewer for this conference. We would like to ask you to consider this question carefully, because without the support of the MOCO community in this process, it becomes very challenging to organize the conference. We would appreciate your engagement and contribution very much.
