## Artist Vouchers

Since its inception, the MOCO initiative has been characterized not only by its interdisciplinary approach but also by its emphasis on fostering artist-scholar dialogues and collaboration. However, without institutional support, it can be challenging for artists to participate in academic conferences. That is why MOCO’24 is introducing Artist Vouchers, an initiative co-funded by the collaborative partners and contributors to this event: Utrecht University, the SPRING Performing Arts Festival, and the MOCO community. Who is eligible to apply for an Artist Voucher? Independent artists who are not affiliated with a higher education institution. How can you apply? Simply send a short biography and motivation (maximum 500 words) to [moco24@uu.nl](mailto:moco24@uu.nl) before 30 April, mentioning ‘Artist Voucher Application’ in the subject.

## SPRING Performing Arts Festival

Tickets for the SPRING Performing Arts Festival will be available for purchase starting Thursday 4 April. Please note that these tickets are not included in the conference registration fee and must be acquired separately. We highly recommend securing tickets for the two performances curated specifically for the delegates of the MOCO’24 conference by SPRING’s artistic director Grzegorz Reske:

1. ​ Agrupación Senor Serrano – Una Isla (Friday 31 May, 19:00-20:10)

   https://springutrecht.nl/en/programme/una-isla/

1. ​ Choy Ka Fai – Unbearable Darkness (Saturday 1 June, 20:00-21:00)

   https://springutrecht.nl/en/programme/unbearable-darkness/

## Accommodation in and around Utrecht

Given the busy schedule in Utrecht during MOCO, including the SPRING Performing Arts Festival and Utrecht Pride on Saturday 1 June, we advise you to arrange accommodation without delay. Booking.com and Airbnb are recommended platforms for accommodation search. Additionally, considering the excellent public transportation network in the Netherlands, staying in nearby towns/cities might be worth considering. For example, the train journey from Rotterdam to Utrecht takes 37 minutes, the train from Amsterdam to Utrecht takes 27 minutes.
